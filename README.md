# Getting started with NodeJS

## Define Monolithic architecture

Monolithic architecture is a software architecture pattern where an application is built as a single, indivisible unit, with all of its components tightly integrated and dependent on one another. In a monolithic architecture, the entire application is usually deployed as a single unit to a single server or set of servers.

The monolithic architecture pattern is characterized by the following traits:

1. All functionality is contained within a single codebase, which can make it easier to develop and test the application.
2. The application is deployed as a single unit, which can simplify deployment and maintenance.
3. There is a single database, which can help ensure data consistency and reduce the need for complex data synchronization across multiple services.
4. There is tight coupling between components, which can make it harder to modify or scale individual components independently.

While monolithic architectures can be easier to develop and deploy, they can also become unwieldy as the application grows in size and complexity. In particular, it can be difficult to maintain and scale a monolithic application, as changes to one part of the application can have unintended consequences on other parts. This is why many organizations are moving away from monolithic architectures in favor of more flexible, scalable microservices architectures.

## Explain microservices in your own understanding

Microservices is a software architecture pattern where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network. Each microservice performs a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of the other services.

In a microservices architecture, each service is typically responsible for a single business capability and has its own database, which allows for greater flexibility in development and deployment. Services communicate with each other using lightweight protocols such as REST (Representational State Transfer) or messaging systems like RabbitMQ.

The benefits of using a microservices architecture include: 
Scalability, Flexibility, Maintainability of the services.

Example of a microservice architecture is building an e-commerce application.
You have different services like:

1. User Service - responsible for user registration, authentication, and authorization
2. Product Service - responsible for managing product catalogs, prices, and availability
3. Cart Service - responsible for managing shopping carts and order placement
4. Payment Service - responsible for handling payment transactions
5. Shipping Service - responsible for managing shipping logistics and tracking
6. Notification Service - responsible for sending notifications to users about their orders and other updates

Each service is deployed independently and communicates with other services through APIs. This allows for better scalability, fault tolerance, and easier maintenance compared to a monolithic architecture.

However, a microservices architecture also has some challenges, such as increased complexity in managing and deploying multiple services and the need for effective communication and coordination between services.

## Which of the backend architecture appeals to you and why?

The microservices architecture appeals to me more because it has a more robust benefit. Looking at the example of an e-commerce application I gave above, we can deduce that microservices offers the following which is beneficial to most high tech companies with lots of traffic:

- Scalability: Services can be scaled independently, allowing for greater flexibility in handling varying levels of traffic and demand.
- Resilience: Since each service is independent, failures in one service do not affect the operation of other services.
- Flexibility: Since each service is independent, it can be developed and deployed independently, which allows for faster development and deployment cycles.
- Maintainability: Microservices architecture makes it easier to maintain and evolve complex applications, since changes to one service do not require changes to the entire application.

## Is Nodejs a multithreaded language?

Technically, Node.js itself is not a multithreaded language. Node.js is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine, which uses a single thread to execute JavaScript code. However, Node.js has a feature called the event loop, which allows it to handle multiple requests simultaneously by using asynchronous I/O operations. This means that Node.js can handle multiple requests without getting blocked, even though it uses a single thread.

## What does REPL stand for?

REPL stands for: Read-Eval-Print-Loop

It is an interactive programming environment that allows the user to enter a command or expression and see the result.
